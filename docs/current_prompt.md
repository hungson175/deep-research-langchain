âœ… COMPLETED: MrW Explorer Pipeline

Created automated pipeline in `src/agents/mrw_explorer.py`:
- Uses topics_generator to generate research topics
- Feeds each topic sequentially into Deep Research
- Creates fresh DeepResearch instance per topic to avoid state issues
- NOT running in parallel (sequential for stability)
- Comprehensive summary table with success/failure tracking

Usage:
```bash
python -m src.agents.mrw_explorer D    # Daily (1 topic)
python -m src.agents.mrw_explorer W    # Weekly (1 topic)
python -m src.agents.mrw_explorer M    # Monthly (3 topics)
python -m src.agents.mrw_explorer Q    # Quarterly (3 topics)
python -m src.agents.mrw_explorer Y    # Yearly (5 topics)
```

Key improvements:
1. Fresh DeepResearch instance per topic (no state leakage)
2. Sequential execution (stable, not parallel)
3. Comprehensive error handling
4. Summary table with results tracking
5. Updated CLAUDE.md documentation
