**Important** not changing this file
- remove v1 : /Users/sonph36/dev/deep_research_mrW/deep_research_langchain/src/agents/complete_workflow_v1.py
- 

# Notes for me, don't read, don't execute
- consider: luu lai attack strategies -> bieu hien tren dashboard UI later on (QUESTIONS may be even more important than reports)
- consider: ranking phai tung file mot: phasewise - phase 1: cho vao sqlite da - phase sau (later): 
- State tracking for competitie workflow: refactor out the state tracking, to reuse the same code for version 1 and 2 ?
  

# Archieve, to be removed soon, dont read, no need to understand or execute
- remove fancy printing (rich) from sub-agents - they make the codes too long and hard to read (let it be in deep-research, or VERY LONG RUNNING pipeline )
- need to validate: ranking each file in separated LLM calls - phasewise - phase 1: put results in sqlite - later phase: update to supabase (later - dont implement here)
