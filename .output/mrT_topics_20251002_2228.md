As a Vietnam-centric platform focused on financial inclusion, MoMo must adapt to reduce cross-border fees and tap into regional trade (e.g., RMB-denominated growth with China), or risk losing users to integrated super-apps like Grab or ShopeePay, impacting its core business protection and new opportunity incubation.

**Specific Areas to Investigate:**
- Technical and regulatory details of Nexus (e.g., one-connection multilateral access) and bilateral links (e.g., Vietnam-Singapore DEA), including timelines and interoperability standards for QR/VietQR.
- Current MoMo cross-border volumes (e.g., with Alipay/WeChat for tourists) and projected growth under new systems, versus competitors like UnionPay's 40+ SEA partnerships.
- User behavior shifts, such as adoption rates for low-fee remittances (SEA volume doubling by 2030) among MoMo's 30M+ users, and risks from de-dollarization (e.g., 27% YoY RMB trade increase with Malaysia).
- Economic impacts, including cost savings (e.g., 50-70% fee reductions) and challenges like AML/privacy compliance across borders.
- Partnership models, such as MoMo's potential integration with NAPAS for real-time rails or collaborations with SEA fintechs.

**Expected Insights or Outcomes:** A roadmap for MoMo's cross-border strategy, including 2-3 pilot integrations (e.g., Nexus testing) to capture 15-25% of regional remittance flows, risk mitigation for currency volatility, and revenue projections showing USD 100M+ uplift by 2028, positioning MoMo as a SEA leader in seamless payments.

## Research Brief 3

### Research Brief 3: Evolving Competitive Landscape from Super-Apps and Digital Banks in Vietnam's E-Wallet Market

**Research Objective/Question:** Evaluate the intensifying competition from super-apps (e.g., Grab, ShopeePay) and digital banks (e.g., Cake by VPBank) on MoMo's market share, and identify defensive and offensive strategies to maintain leadership in mobile payments.

**Background Context:** MoMo holds a top position in Vietnam's e-wallet market (90% share with peers), but 2025 trends show super-apps expanding via consolidations (e.g., Sea Ltd's ShopeePay investments) and digital banks achieving profitability (e.g., Cake's 2024 success), amid 75%+ digital transactions. This threatens MoMo's user base (32M+ active) and productivity gains from ecosystem integrations, as competitors leverage B2B expansions and e-commerce ties, potentially eroding MoMo's innovation edge and user trust in a market growing to USD 15B in e-payments by 2025.

**Specific Areas to Investigate:**
- Market share dynamics: Current breakdowns (e.g., MoMo vs. ZaloPay's 269 partners) and 2025 projections, including super-app transaction growth (e.g., 5x e-wallet value to USD 114B in SEA).
- Competitor strategies: Digital banks' retail focus (e.g., VPBank's 15.4M users) and super-apps' B2B/BNPL pushes (Vietnam BNPL at USD 491M in 2021, growing rapidly).
- User retention factors: Surveys on switching behaviors (e.g., 60% SEA QR adoption) and MoMo's strengths in inclusion vs. competitors' seamless experiences.
- M&A trends: Potential consolidations (e.g., Grab-Moca stakes) and foreign influences (e.g., UnionPay's 228B global transactions).
- Barriers to entry/exit: Impact of NPL rises (4.8% in 2024) on lending competitors and MoMo's non-bank advantages.

**Expected Insights or Outcomes:** Competitive benchmarking report with 4-6 tactics for MoMo, such as super-app partnerships to defend 70%+ share, targeted marketing for Gen Z retention, and diversification into BNPL, yielding insights on sustaining 20%+ annual growth while addressing blind spots like real estate-linked risks.
