### 1. Attack Strategy

**Identified Weakness**: According to public reports from Decision Lab and Mobile Marketing Association Vietnam (2025), MoMo is experiencing a 'plateau' in user engagement, particularly in the Gen Z and millennial segment, due to a lack of deep integration with the social ecosystem. MoMo operates as a standalone app with over 30 million users but does not leverage the 'social graph' to promote social payment features like group sharing, P2P gifting, or viral sharing via social media. Internal data shows Q3 2025 GMV at 340 trillion VND, but no specific metrics on social engagement, leading to lower retention rates among young users compared to social-integrated super apps (e.g., only 15% of Gen Z prefer MoMo for social transactions per Connected Consumer Q4 2024 report).

**Exploitation Approach**: ZaloPay will leverage its seamless integration with Zalo – a messaging platform with 100 million global users – to transform ZaloPay into an 'open payment platform' with strong social features, attracting MoMo users seeking viral and personalized social payment experiences. This will differentiate from MoMo's standalone model, targeting Gen Z/millennials (55% of the population under 35 per Invest Vietnam 2025), by making payments a natural extension of daily communication on Zalo.

**Execution Steps**: 1. Develop and launch 'Zalo Group Payments' and 'P2P Gifting' features integrated directly into Zalo chat, allowing group bill splitting or sending money with messages, with 5-10% cashback for first social transactions (deploy in Q4 2025). 2. Partner with KOLs and influencers on Zalo OA for viral campaigns, encouraging MoMo users to switch via multi-purpose ZaloPay QR codes, targeting 5 million young users through targeted ads (starting November 2025). 3. Integrate VNG AI for personalized payment suggestions based on Zalo chat history (e.g., gift suggestions from conversations), and expand to 52,000 current partners for social payments at points of sale (complete integration in 6 months). 4. Monitor and optimize via A/B testing on the Zalo app, adjusting based on feedback from 1 million initial beta users. 5. Amplify cross-platform marketing, linking with Zalo events like Tet 2026 to drive conversions from MoMo.

**Expected Impact**: Attract 3-5 million Gen Z/millennial users from MoMo in 2026, increase ZaloPay market share to 60% in the youth segment, and drive 150% YoY growth in social transactions, contributing to 200% revenue growth in financial services compared to 2024.

**Success Metrics**: - Conversion rate of MoMo users to ZaloPay via social features (>20% from KOL campaigns, measured via Zalo analytics). - Increase in engagement rate (social transactions/month) to 30% above Q3 2025 baseline. - Net Promoter Score (NPS) from young users >70, via quarterly surveys. - Market share tracking via Decision Lab reports, targeting 5-7% increase in Gen Z within 12 months.

### 2. Attack Strategy

**Identified Weakness**: Internal MoMo data for Q3 2025 shows high entertainment transactions (Games: 2.48 million, Digital Content: 7.83 million, Cinema: 4.17 million, OTT: 1.76 million), but lacks deep integration with the entertainment ecosystem, resulting in low engagement among Gen Z/millennials – the group prioritizing 'intimate and routine-integrated' experiences per Decision Lab Q4 2024 report. MoMo holds 68% overall market share but only about 25% in Gen Z due to no viral mechanisms via social gaming or personalized content, while 2025 trends emphasize audio streaming and live commerce (YouTube leads with 75% usage, which MoMo has not effectively tapped).

**Exploitation Approach**: ZaloPay will exploit VNG's ecosystem advantages (including games, music, content) to integrate seamless payments into Zalo entertainment activities, creating a 'viral loop' for Gen Z/millennials – comprising 70% of the under-35 population and shifting away from standalone apps like MoMo. By positioning ZaloPay as the default payment tool for gaming and entertainment, we will attract young MoMo users through combined social-entertainment experiences, leveraging Zalo's 100 million user base for superior engagement.

**Execution Steps**: 1. Integrate ZaloPay directly into VNG games (e.g., Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ) and Zalo OTT platforms, enabling in-app payments with 10% cashback for first game/OTT transactions, targeting 10 million young users (launch Q1 2026). 2. Partner with audio/live platforms like YouTube and TikTok Shop for 'ZaloPay Live Payments' for cinema/OTT tickets, combined with Zalo groups for viral discount code sharing (start campaign with 50 gaming KOLs in December 2025). 3. Use Zalo data for personalized entertainment offers (e.g., cinema ticket suggestions based on chat history), and expand to 81,000 payment points for offline content purchases (complete in 4 months). 4. Launch 'ZaloPay Game Pass' loyalty program with points accumulation from entertainment transactions, redeemable for VNG ecosystem rewards, attracting 2 million MoMo users via targeted Zalo ads. 5. Evaluate and scale via real-time VNG analytics data, adjusting based on young user retention rates.

**Expected Impact**: Increase entertainment transactions from Gen Z/millennials by 40%, attract 4 million new users from MoMo in 18 months, raise ZaloPay market share in gaming/entertainment to 55%, and boost revenue from these services by 180% YoY.

**Success Metrics**: - Number of entertainment transactions via ZaloPay (target 50% QoQ increase, compared to MoMo's 2.48M game transactions in Q3 2025). - Monthly active Gen Z users (>30% growth, measured via Zalo demographics). - Engagement metrics like average daily app usage time for ZaloPay entertainment (>15 minutes/day). - Segment market share per Statista/Mordor Intelligence reports, targeting 10% increase in Gen Z in the first year.

### 3. Attack Strategy

**Identified Weakness**: Although MoMo partnered with Grab in 2023 for payment integration (enabling e-wallet and Pay Later access in the Grab app), it lacks depth in integrated financial services (loans, savings, investments), with low engagement in these products per 2025 fintech trends (Verified Market Research report: only 35% use open banking APIs, and MoMo faced funding challenges at $800 million in 2023). Internal data access failed for specific metrics, but public reports indicate MoMo has not fully tapped the unbanked population (51% of adults, 37 million people), especially in rural/Tier 2-3 cities where Zalo has broader coverage.

**Exploitation Approach**: As Grab's official payment partner since January 2023, ZaloPay will deepen integration into the Grab and VNG ecosystems, focusing on comprehensive financial services (8-13% interest savings, quick loans, investments) to attract MoMo users seeking seamless financial solutions. We will leverage our network of 13 banks (57% coverage) and Zalo's social graph to offer a 'one-app' experience for Grab payments + finance, targeting underserved segments like rural users and Gen Z needing micro-investing.

**Execution Steps**: 1. Upgrade ZaloPay integration in the Grab app to support 'On-the-Go Loans & Savings' (e.g., quick loans for Grab rides at 8-10% interest, 5% cashback for savings deposits), prioritizing 16 million current ZaloPay users (launch Q4 2025). 2. Expand partnerships with Grab and 13 banks to deploy 'ZaloPay Financial Hub' on Zalo, enabling micro-investments and installment payments for Grab services (target 5 million Tier 2-3 users via localization). 3. Run conversion campaigns from MoMo with exclusive Grab perks (20% loan fee reduction for switchers to ZaloPay), promoted via Zalo feeds and Grab notifications (start January 2026). 4. Integrate VNG AI for personalized financial products based on Grab/Zalo data (e.g., savings suggestions from travel history), and expand to 100+ financial services (complete in 9 months). 5. Monitor via partnership KPIs with Grab, adjusting based on feedback from 500,000 beta users.

**Expected Impact**: Attract 2-4 million users from MoMo via Grab channels, increase ZaloPay market share in financial services to 62%, and drive 196% YoY financial revenue growth, contributing to 20 million active users by 2027.

**Success Metrics**: - Number of financial transactions via Grab integration (>1 million/month, 50% increase from 2024 baseline). - MoMo user conversion rate (>15%, measured via app tracking codes). - Revenue from loans/savings (150% YoY increase, per VNG internal reports). - Fintech market share per Mordor Intelligence, targeting 8% increase in rural segments within 12 months.
