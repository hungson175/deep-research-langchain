### Research Brief 2: Competitive Dynamics from Super-App Expansion and Cross-Border QR Interoperability

**Research Objective/Question:** Evaluate the threat posed by super-app expansions (e.g., GrabPay, ShopeePay) and cross-border QR linkages to MoMo's domestic dominance, and develop strategies for interoperability to capture regional transaction flows.

**Background Context:** MoMo's core business in mobile payments faces intensification from competitors like Grab and Shopee, who bundle payments with e-commerce and ride-hailing, amid SE Asia's mobile wallet surge to 66% of POS payments by 2027. Vietnam's VietQR standardization and cross-border pilots with Thailand, Singapore, Cambodia, and Laos (effective 2025) could fragment MoMo's $47.6B market if not leveraged, especially as remote payments (69% share) grow via QR codes. This is critical for protecting MoMo's user trust and 73 million+ users, as non-adoption risks a 20-30% erosion in P2P and retail transactions in a cashless economy push targeting 80% public services by 2030.

**Specific Areas to Investigate:**
- Market share shifts in urban vs. rural Vietnam post-2025 QR interoperability, including transaction volumes for MoMo vs. competitors like VNPAY and ViettelPay.
- Super-app strategies in HCMC and Hanoi hubs, such as partnerships for BNPL or embedded finance, and their impact on MoMo's 61% retail end-user dominance.
- Regulatory enablers and barriers under SBV's cashless initiatives, including fees for cross-border QR and merchant onboarding trends (e.g., 1.2% growth impact).
- User behavior data on switching costs and loyalty, focusing on youth demographics (70% under 40) in SE Asia's $500B internet economy projection by 2030.

**Expected Insights or Outcomes:** Competitive benchmarking report with scenarios for MoMo's market share (e.g., maintaining 35-40% via API integrations), including partnership opportunities for cross-border expansion; projected ROI on QR enhancements to boost transaction values by 15-20%, positioning MoMo as an ASEAN payment hub.

### Research Brief 3: Adoption of AI and Biometric Security in Fraud Prevention and User Trust

**Research Objective/Question:** Analyze the integration of AI-driven fraud detection and biometric authentication (e.g., post-magnetic stripe discontinuation) to strengthen MoMo's security posture, and forecast its role in reducing cyber-fraud risks amid rising digital transactions.

**Background Context:** With Vietnam's fintech market exploding to $15.4B in 2025 (CAGR 17.8%), MoMo must address cyber-fraud restraints (-1.3% market impact) highlighted in 2025 regulations like Circular 17/2024 mandating biometrics for corporate accounts and the July 2025 magnetic stripe ban. This is vital for sustaining user trust in a sector where AI could yield 7-9% cost savings and 9% revenue growth by 2027, especially as mobile payments hit $475B regionally. Blind spots include rural low financial literacy (-0.9% impact), potentially amplifying fraud in MoMo's inclusion efforts for 290M unbanked in SE Asia.

**Specific Areas to Investigate:**
- Effectiveness of biometric upgrades (e.g., chip ID/VNeID integration) in reducing fraud by 57%, with case studies from peers like ZaloPay.
- AI applications in real-time risk assessment, including Visa's $3B investments and SE Asia pilots for phishing/deepfake prevention.
- Compliance costs and user adoption rates for mandatory verifications, segmented by urban (45% transactions) vs. rural areas.
- Emerging threats like AI agents in fraud (e.g., H1 2025 KPMG report) and regulatory data management priorities.

**Expected Insights or Outcomes:** Implementation framework for AI-biometric enhancements, estimating fraud reduction (e.g., 40-50% drop) and user retention gains; cost-benefit analysis to support MoMo's innovation budget, ensuring alignment with SBV's cybersecurity mandates for long-term trust.
