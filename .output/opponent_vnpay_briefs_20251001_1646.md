## Competitive Research Brief 1

### Strategic Research Brief 1: Leveraging Banking Partnerships for Superior Financial Product Depth

**Clear Research Objective:** How can VNPay utilize its 40+ bank partnerships to offer integrated banking-grade financial services that surpass MoMo's consumer-focused fintech limitations?

**Background Context:** MoMo dominates consumer e-wallet usage with 68% market share and strong GMV growth (e.g., 339T VND in Q3 2025), but internal data access issues on financial products like loans, investments, and insurance suggest underdeveloped or siloed offerings reliant on limited bank ties. Public trends show MoMo's partnerships (e.g., Chubb for insurance) are reactive and consumer-oriented, lacking the depth for enterprise-scale financial services. VNPay's extensive bank network positions it to exploit this gap, providing seamless, compliant products MoMo can't match without deeper integrations, especially amid Vietnam's 2025 push for financial inclusion via open APIs and digital banking hybrids.

**Specific Investigation Areas:**
- Use query_momo_data to probe MoMo's financial product metrics: Focused queries on engagement (e.g., "Số lượng user active trong sản phẩm vay vốn và đầu tư của MoMo Q1-Q3 2025") and revenue from non-core services (e.g., "Doanh thu từ bảo hiểm và savings products năm 2025").
- Employ tavily_search for public intelligence: Trends in Vietnam's fintech regulatory sandbox (e.g., "Vietnam open API banking partnerships 2025 MoMo limitations"), MoMo's bank collaborations (e.g., "MoMo bank integrations vs competitors 2025"), and customer sentiment on financial product trust (e.g., "MoMo loan insurance complaints Vietnam 2025").
- Analyze VNPay's internal data on bank-linked services (e.g., cross-border remittances via Visa/UnionPay) and market gaps in underserved segments like SMEs needing integrated lending.

**Expected Strategic Insights:** This research will reveal MoMo's weak conversion from payments to financial products (e.g., low engagement in rural areas), enabling VNPay to design bundled offerings like AI-driven credit scoring via bank data. Insights will inform decisions on prioritizing partnerships for co-branded products, targeting MoMo's 90% multi-app users frustrated with security, and launching pilots in high-GMV sectors like e-commerce to bridge B2B revenue to consumer adoption.

**Success Metrics:** Achieve 15% YoY growth in VNPay's financial product user base by Q4 2026; increase cross-sell rate from payments to loans/insurance to 25% among existing users; monitor market share gain in SME financial services to 20% via Statista/competitor reports, with NPS scores >70 for integrated banking features.

### Strategic Research Brief 2: Capturing Enterprise and Merchant Opportunities Through Superior B2B Infrastructure

**Clear Research Objective:** How can VNPay expand its 350,000+ merchant network and B2B solutions to capture market share from MoMo's fluctuating merchant engagement and limited enterprise depth?

**Background Context:** MoMo's merchant revenue grew to 42T VND in 2025 (YTD) with network expansion to 128k merchants by Sep 2025, but dips in transaction volumes (e.g., Feb/Jun/Jul 2025) indicate engagement gaps, possibly due to interface clutter and rural limitations per customer reviews. Public data highlights MoMo's consumer super-app focus over robust B2B tools, with weaknesses in merchant onboarding and retention amid Vietnam's 2025 fintech trends emphasizing enterprise digitization (e.g., smart factories, logistics). VNPay's largest acceptance points and tools like SoftPOS NFC provide a compliance edge to target underserved SMEs and e-commerce enterprises MoMo hasn't fully captured.

**Specific Investigation Areas:**
- Leverage query_momo_data for internal weaknesses: Queries on merchant gaps (e.g., "Tỷ lệ churn merchant và low-activity segments của MoMo 2025") and B2B transaction patterns (e.g., "Doanh thu từ enterprise integrations như POS và gateways năm 2025").
- Conduct tavily_search on market trends: MoMo's B2B challenges (e.g., "MoMo merchant complaints rural Vietnam 2025"), competitor enterprise moves (e.g., "Vietnam B2B payment infrastructure trends 2025 VNPay vs MoMo"), and regulatory support for merchant digitization (e.g., "State Bank Vietnam QR standards enterprise 2025").
- Review VNPay's data on high-coverage sectors (e.g., transportation, healthcare) and identify white-spaces like small business e-invoicing where MoMo lags.

**Expected Strategic Insights:** Findings will expose MoMo's seasonal dips as opportunities for VNPay to offer stable, AI-powered merchant tools (e.g., biometric eKYC for faster onboarding), enabling decisions on targeted campaigns in rural/seasonal segments and partnerships with 200+ e-commerce firms to convert B2B strength into consumer wallet adoption. This could reveal paths to integrate VNPay's payment gateways with MoMo-vulnerable enterprises, driving 106.7% QR growth further.

**Success Metrics:** Grow VNPay merchant network by 20% to 420,000 points by end-2026; reduce merchant churn to <10% via engagement tools; achieve 25% market share in B2B payments (per industry reports), measured by increased transaction volume from new enterprises (>30% YoY) and consumer referrals from merchant ecosystems.

### Strategic Research Brief 3: Exploiting Cross-Border and Digital Transformation Gaps for International and Compliance Leadership

**Clear Research Objective:** How can VNPay's international card partnerships and digital tools (e.g., eKYC, VNeDOC) outmaneuver MoMo's underdeveloped cross-border capabilities and regulatory compliance challenges?

**Background Context:** MoMo shows no significant cross-border transaction data in 2025 queries, with public reports citing institutional gaps like non-mandatory QR standards, fraud risks, and limited inbound payments despite initiatives (e.g., Thailand/Cambodia links). Customer complaints highlight foreigner access issues (e.g., biometric mandates) and rural limitations, while Vietnam's 2025 e-ID/VNeID rollout demands advanced digital tools MoMo's consumer model underprepares for. VNPay's Visa/UnionPay/PayPal ties and award-winning eKYC/e-documents offer a regulatory and international edge to target global remittances and enterprise compliance, converting B2B infrastructure into consumer growth.

**Specific Investigation Areas:**
- Apply query_momo_data to confirm gaps: Targeted queries on cross-border metrics (e.g., "Số lượng giao dịch cross-border và limitations của MoMo Q1-Q3 2025") and digital tool engagement (e.g., "Engagement metrics cho eKYC và compliance features năm 2025").
- Use tavily_search for broader intelligence: MoMo's international weaknesses (e.g., "MoMo cross-border payment failures Vietnam 2025"), trends in ASEAN QR interoperability (e.g., "Vietnam cross-border fintech regulations 2025"), and digital transformation demands (e.g., "VNeID e-documents adoption MoMo vs banks 2025").
- Assess VNPay's assets: Analyze internal data on cross-border volumes via partnerships and eKYC usage in enterprises to benchmark against MoMo's low activity.

**Expected Strategic Insights:** Research will uncover MoMo's cross-border underdevelopment (e.g., zero matching data) as a vulnerability, guiding VNPay to launch foreigner-friendly remittances and e-document bundles for SMEs. Insights will enable multi-year strategies like regulatory lobbying via bank allies for faster sandbox approvals, targeting MoMo's multi-app users with seamless international features to boost consumer adoption from 16% share.

**Success Metrics:** Increase VNPay cross-border transaction volume by 50% YoY by 2026; achieve 30% market share in international payments (tracked via SBV reports); measure success by eKYC adoption rate >40% among enterprises, reduced compliance complaints (<5% of reviews), and consumer market share growth to 25% through cross-border user influx.
