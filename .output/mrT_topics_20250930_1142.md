### Research Brief: Implications of Vietnam's Virtual Assets Pilot Program on MoMo's Mobile Payment Ecosystem

**Research Objective/Question:**  
Assess the strategic opportunities and risks posed by Vietnam's five-year pilot program for virtual assets (crypto) market (Resolution No. 05/2025/NQ-CP, issued September 9, 2025) to MoMo's core mobile payment operations, financial inclusion initiatives, and long-term innovation roadmap. Specifically, investigate: How can MoMo integrate or hedge against crypto-fiat interoperability while maintaining user trust and regulatory compliance in a VND-dominated ecosystem?

**Background Context:**  
As Vietnam's leading mobile payment platform with over 30 million users, MoMo has driven financial inclusion by enabling seamless digital transactions, remittances, and access to basic financial services for underserved populations in a cash-heavy economy. The government's new pilot program introduces a regulated framework for crypto asset issuance and trading, limited initially to foreign investors and backed by real assets, with all transactions in VND and strict AML/CTF requirements overseen by the Ministry of Finance. This marks Vietnam's first formal crypto integration, aligning with global fintech trends but imposing high barriers (e.g., VND 10 trillion minimum capital for service providers). For MoMo, this development matters critically as it could disrupt fiat-based payments by enabling crypto on-ramps/off-ramps, attract foreign capital that bypasses traditional wallets, and challenge user trust if volatility or scams erode confidence. Amid rising competition from digital banks like Cake and cross-border initiatives (e.g., Nexus Global Payments), failing to adapt risks ceding ground in innovation and inclusion, while proactive engagement could position MoMo as a bridge between traditional mobile payments and emerging digital assets, enhancing productivity and new revenue streams like tokenized remittances.

**Specific Areas to Investigate:**  
1. **Regulatory Integration and Compliance Risks:** Analyze the pilot's rules on VND-only transactions, foreign investor restrictions, and licensing (e.g., 65% institutional ownership, cybersecurity mandates) to evaluate MoMo's eligibility as a service provider or partner; map potential overlaps/conflicts with existing State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) mobile payment regulations and fintech sandbox (Decree No. 94/2025/ND-CP).  
2. **Impact on User Behavior and Financial Inclusion:** Survey MoMo users (focusing on unbanked/rural segments) for crypto awareness, adoption intent, and trust concerns; assess how crypto could accelerate inclusion (e.g., low-cost remittances for overseas Vietnamese) versus risks like volatility excluding low-income users. Compare with SEA peers (e.g., GCash's crypto pilots in Philippines).  
3. **Competitive and Technological Landscape:** Profile competitor responses (e.g., digital banks like Cake or VPBank integrating blockchain; Chinese firms like Alipay expanding via QR diplomacy); evaluate technical feasibility of crypto-fiat bridges for MoMo's app (e.g., AI-driven wallets, blockchain APIs) and talent gaps in blockchain/AML expertise.  
4. **Market Dynamics and Economic Projections:** Forecast crypto market growth in Vietnam (e.g., licensed exchanges, foreign investment inflows) and its effects on mobile payment volumes; model scenarios for MoMo's revenue (e.g., 10-20% uplift from hybrid services vs. 5-15% erosion from disintermediation). Include blind spots like long-term SBV policy shifts post-pilot and geopolitical influences on foreign crypto adoption.

**Expected Insights or Outcomes:**  
This research will deliver a strategic playbook for MoMo, including: (1) A compliance roadmap with actionable steps for pilot participation (e.g., partnerships with licensed exchanges); (2) User-centric innovation recommendations, such as pilot crypto features for remittances to boost inclusion metrics by 15-20%; (3) Risk mitigation strategies against competition and volatility, potentially identifying VND 500-1,000 billion in new opportunities; and (4) A 3-5 year horizon scan for transformational disruptions, informing board-level decisions on R&D investments (e.g., blockchain talent acquisition) to safeguard MoMo's market leadership and user trust in Southeast Asia's evolving fintech landscape.
