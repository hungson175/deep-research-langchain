### Strategic Research Brief 1: Enhancing Social Payment Features for Gen Z Engagement

**Research Objective:** How can ZaloPay (VNG Corporation) leverage Zalo's social graph to introduce viral social payment features that capture Gen Z users from MoMo?

**Background Context:** MoMo holds a dominant 68% market share with over 31 million users, but internal engagement data reveals significant weaknesses in social interactions among Gen Z (ages 18-22), with 2.67 million unique visits but only 210,620 chat actions in 2025 YTD—indicating low retention and social stickiness in a standalone app. Public app reviews highlight frustrations with glitches and poor UX for peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions, creating a gap for ZaloPay's seamless integration with Zalo's 100M+ user base, where Gen Z already engages daily via messaging and groups.

**Specific Investigation Areas:** 
- Use query_momo_data to query MoMo's P2P transaction volumes and engagement drop-off rates for Gen Z in social features (e.g., "Số lượng giao dịch P2P và tỷ lệ retention cho user Gen Z trong 2025").
- Employ tavily_search for trends in Gen Z fintech preferences (e.g., "Gen Z Vietnam social payment trends 2025 app reviews") and MoMo's social feature limitations from user sentiment on forums and app stores.
- Analyze ZaloPay's internal data on Zalo-integrated payments and partnerships for group gifting or split-bill features.

**Expected Strategic Insights:** This research will identify untapped opportunities in social payments (e.g., in-app gifting via Zalo groups) where MoMo lags, enabling decisions on product roadmaps like AI-driven viral sharing tools to boost acquisition by 20-30% among Gen Z, while exploiting MoMo's low chat engagement to drive cross-app retention.

**Success Metrics:** Increase in Gen Z user acquisition (target: 15% YoY growth via Zalo referrals); rise in social transaction volume (e.g., P2P/gifting >25% of total transactions); improved Net Promoter Score (NPS) among 18-27 y/o users to >70, measured quarterly through app analytics.

### Strategic Research Brief 2: Deepening Entertainment and Gaming Integration

**Research Objective:** How can ZaloPay (VNG Corporation) integrate payments into VNG's gaming ecosystem to surpass MoMo's entertainment transaction volumes?

**Background Context:** MoMo's entertainment and gaming transactions remain steady at 4-5 million per month in 2025 (peaking at 5.7M in August), but public market intelligence shows no explosive growth or deep ecosystem ties, with app reviews complaining about transaction failures and limited in-game payment options. ZaloPay's VNG backing provides a unique edge through Zalo's 100M+ users and VNG's gaming portfolio, targeting Gen Z/millennials who spend heavily on digital content but find MoMo's standalone app less immersive.

**Specific Investigation Areas:** 
- Query query_momo_data for detailed breakdowns of MoMo's gaming transaction retention and user demographics (e.g., "Tỷ lệ retention và số user Gen Z trong giao dịch gaming của MoMo Q1-Q3 2025").
- Use tavily_search to research Vietnam's gaming market trends (e.g., "Vietnam gaming payment integration trends 2025 MoMo weaknesses") and competitor partnerships in esports/content streaming.
- Evaluate VNG's internal metrics on Zalo-integrated gaming payments and potential expansions like micro-transactions in popular titles.

**Expected Strategic Insights:** Insights will reveal MoMo's stagnation in entertainment (e.g., lack of seamless in-game wallets), guiding ZaloPay to launch embedded payment rails in VNG games, potentially capturing 10-15% market share shift by bundling rewards and social sharing, and informing multi-year investments in AR/VR payment experiences.

**Success Metrics:** Growth in entertainment/gaming transaction volume (target: 40% YoY increase to exceed MoMo's 5M/month benchmark); higher average transaction value per Gen Z user (>20% uplift); partnership-driven user crossover from Zalo to ZaloPay (measured as >1M new activations via gaming events annually).

### Strategic Research Brief 3: Expanding Financial Services Depth and Partnerships

**Research Objective:** How can ZaloPay (VNG Corporation) deepen financial services offerings and forge exclusive partnerships to erode MoMo's lead in loans, savings, and investments?

**Background Context:** Despite MoMo's super app ambitions and 68% share, public app reviews in 2025 frequently cite glitches in financial transactions, security vulnerabilities (e.g., no re-authentication post-OTP), and delays in loans/savings—exacerbating trust issues amid regulatory pushes for data protection. ZaloPay's existing partnerships (e.g., Grab since 2023) and comprehensive ecosystem (100+ services including 8-13% interest loans) position it to exploit these gaps, especially as internal MoMo data access failures suggest operational inefficiencies in financial products.

**Specific Investigation Areas:** 
- Leverage query_momo_data for MoMo's financial services metrics where possible (e.g., "Số lượng user active và GMV cho loans/savings của MoMo trong 2025") or fallback to aggregated trends.
- Conduct tavily_search on MoMo's partnership landscape and complaints (e.g., "MoMo Vietnam financial services reviews partnerships Grab 2025") and emerging trends like embedded finance with banks.
- Review ZaloPay's internal partnership data with 13 banks and Grab, identifying white-space opportunities like co-branded installment plans.

**Expected Strategic Insights:** Research will uncover MoMo's UX and reliability weaknesses in financial services, enabling ZaloPay to prioritize secure, Zalo-integrated features (e.g., instant loans via chat) and new alliances (e.g., expanding Grab exclusivity), supporting decisions to launch 2-3 new products in 2026 and target 10% market share gain in non-payment financial services.

**Success Metrics:** Increase in financial services revenue (target: 50% YoY growth); reduction in user complaints (app store rating >4.5/5 for financial features); partnership impact via transaction uplift (e.g., >30% of Grab payments via ZaloPay, tracked monthly through API integrations).
