## Defensive Research Brief 1

### Defensive Research Brief 1: Enhancing Social Ecosystem Integration to Counter Viral Poaching

**Research Objective**: What are the most effective strategies for MoMo to deepen social payment integrations (e.g., P2P, group funds) within existing and new social platforms to match or exceed ZaloPay's seamless chat-based experiences, while driving user retention and viral growth?

**Strategic Context**: ZaloPay's exploitation of our declining social payment engagement (20% drop in P2P users/transactions) leverages Zalo's 78M+ MAU ecosystem for "lock-in" virality, potentially capturing 2-3M of our users and eroding our 68% market share by 5-7%. As MoMo's super-app, we must protect our core payment ecosystem by transforming standalone features into socially embedded ones, preventing migration and reinforcing trust in a market where 70%+ urban transactions are digital. This defends against isolation while aligning with Vietnam's high social media penetration (e.g., Zalo at 82%), turning a weakness into a competitive moat for long-term leadership.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Benchmarking successful social payment integrations globally (e.g., WeChat Pay in China, Venmo in the US) and regionally (e.g., GrabPay's social features in SEA), focusing on UX metrics like app-switch reduction and viral coefficients.
- Analysis of Vietnam-specific social graphs: User overlap between MoMo's 33M users and platforms like Zalo, Facebook, TikTok; sentiment from Reddit/TikTok on pain points (e.g., app fragmentation).
- Technical feasibility: API partnerships with Zalo/Facebook for in-chat payments; regulatory compliance for data sharing under Vietnam's 2026 Cybersecurity Law.
- User behavior data: Internal MoMo metrics on social feature churn vs. competitors; A/B testing pilots for embedded P2P/group tools.
- Competitor tactics: ZaloPay's Q4 2025 "Group Pay" rollout details, including A/B results and OA partnerships.

**Expected Insights**: Identify 3-5 high-ROI integration opportunities (e.g., TikTok chat payments) that could boost social MAU by 30%+ and reduce churn by 15%, enabling decisions on R&D investments ($10-20M budget), partnership negotiations, and product roadmaps to launch counter-features by Q1 2026, shifting 1M+ potential migrants back to MoMo and increasing transaction volume by 20%.

### Defensive Research Brief 2: Accelerating Gen Z and Millennial Acquisition and Retention

**Research Objective**: How can MoMo overhaul onboarding and personalization to capture 3-4M Gen Z/millennial users from ZaloPay, addressing ID barriers and authenticity gaps, while building loyalty through gamified, value-aligned financial tools?

**Strategic Context**: Our lower penetration among Gen Z (45% of under-30 population, 60% of whom favor integrated apps) risks long-term erosion, as ZaloPay targets them via no-registration onboarding and influencer campaigns, potentially gaining 10% youth share and fueling 35% YoY growth to 20M users. With Vietnam's youth driving e-commerce ($24B market) and digital natives prioritizing sustainability/authenticity (60%+ urban preference), MoMo must evolve from a payment utility to a "financial sidekick" to sustain 33M users and 68% share. This counters demographic blind spots, ensures future-proofing against tech disruptions, and leverages our super-app for offensive plays in financial inclusion.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Demographic profiling: Quantified Gen Z/millennial usage data (e.g., Statista/Nielsen updates) on e-wallet preferences, pain points (ID rejections, lack of virality), and migration drivers from MoMo to ZaloPay.
- Onboarding innovations: Global best practices (e.g., simplified biometrics in SEA apps like GCash) and Vietnam regulatory options for reduced ID friction (e.g., eKYC pilots under State Bank guidelines).
- Personalization tactics: AI-driven features like gamified savings (8-13% interest challenges) tied to TikTok influencers; sentiment analysis from 200+ nano-influencers on authenticity vs. MoMo's perceived "corporate" image.
- Retention benchmarks: 3-month retention rates (industry 60%) for youth cohorts; impact of incentives (15% cashback) on acquisition cost vs. lifetime value.
- Campaign effectiveness: ROI of ZaloPay's Q1 2026 influencer blitz (50M impressions); MoMo's university partnerships for financial literacy webinars.

**Expected Insights**: Pinpoint 2-3 scalable interventions (e.g., AI onboarding reducing drop-off by 40%, influencer ROI at 5:1) to achieve 30% new users aged 18-34 and 75% retention, informing a $15M marketing reallocations, product betas with 500K youth testers, and regulatory advocacy for eKYC by Q2 2026—enabling MoMo to flip ZaloPay's youth advantage, add 2M+ users, and boost revenue from youth services (loans/investments) by 40%.

### Defensive Research Brief 3: Strengthening Entertainment and Gaming Payment Ecosystem

**Research Objective**: What strategic partnerships and integrations can MoMo pursue to dominate entertainment/gaming transactions, countering VNG/ZaloPay's "pay-and-play" model and capturing 1.5-2M users from stagnant segments?

**Strategic Context**: Our flat entertainment volumes (1.1-1.7M users, 2-3M transactions) leave us vulnerable to ZaloPay's VNG synergies (79M gaming users, 40% market share), which could double their segment growth and siphon impulse buys in Vietnam's $10B+ digital entertainment boom. As a $2B+ unicorn, MoMo must diversify beyond basic payments into habitual ecosystem revenue (projected 60% uplift for competitors), protecting overall transaction growth amid a $50B digital economy by 2030. This addresses integration gaps, mitigates regulatory risks (e.g., cross-border gaming), and positions us for offensive expansion, maintaining leadership by blending payments with lifestyle virality.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Market mapping: Transaction volumes in gaming/OTT (e.g., Free Fire, TikTok events) vs. MoMo's share; user crossover data between VNG platforms and MoMo wallets.
- Partnership opportunities: Negotiable deals with 20+ non-VNG players (e.g., cinema chains, music festivals, international games like Roblox); exclusive discounts (10-20% off) via QR integrations.
- Integration tech: Feasibility of one-tap in-app payments (e.g., API with Grab for events); AI personalization for bundles (e.g., game top-ups tied to social gifting).
- Competitor deep dive: ZaloPay's Q4 2025 VNG embeds and Q1 2026 partnerships (e.g., Grab cross-promos); success metrics like 30% QoQ volume growth.
- User insights: Gen Z engagement in gaming (85% daily TikTok/YouTube); complaints on MoMo's clunky alternatives via surveys/forums.

**Expected Insights**: Uncover 4-5 priority partnerships (e.g., TikTok gaming tie-ins yielding 25% transaction uplift) and integration roadmaps to surpass MoMo's current 2.8M monthly entertainment transactions by mid-2026, guiding $20M investment in APIs/partnerships, gamified campaigns for 10M impressions, and metrics tracking (e.g., 5+ tx/user/month)—empowering decisions to shift 1M+ users, gain 15% segment share, and generate 40% YoY revenue from entertainment-linked services, fortifying our super-app against VNG dominance.
