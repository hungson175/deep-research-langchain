## Research Brief 3

### Research Brief 3: Regulatory Changes in Cybersecurity and Data Privacy for Digital Payments

**Research Objective/Question:** Analyze upcoming SBV and regional regulatory shifts in cybersecurity, data privacy, and fraud prevention for digital payments, and outline compliance strategies to safeguard MoMo's operations and user trust.

**Background Context:** With cashless transactions surging (59% of daily payments, 72% among 25-44 year-olds) and Vietnam's interbank system handling 820 trillion VND daily, MoMo is vulnerable to rising cyber threats like deepfake scams and fraud, as highlighted in 2025 advisories from MAS and SBV. New regulations, including the fintech sandbox's risk management requirements and potential amendments to the Cybersecurity Law (aligned with global standards like those in China and Singapore), could impose stricter reporting, AI labeling, and incident response obligations. Non-compliance risks fines up to RMB-equivalent levels and reputational damage, undermining MoMo's focus on user trust in a market where 87% of adults now hold payment accounts.

**Specific Areas to Investigate:**
- Key 2025 regulations: SBV's sandbox rules for P2P lending and open APIs, plus draft Cybersecurity Law amendments on data handling for over 100,000 users and AI-generated content labeling.
- Fraud trends: 2025 incident data in Vietnam and SEA (e.g., scams impersonating financial officials), including impacts on mobile wallets like MoMo.
- Compliance benchmarks: How competitors (e.g., ZaloPay) and regional players (e.g., Thailand's BOT fraud management drafts) are investing in tools like real-time monitoring and eKYC.
- MoMo's exposure: Audit of current systems for vulnerabilities in QR payments and cross-border links (e.g., with Thailand, Laos), plus cost estimates for upgrades.
- Consumer impact: Surveys on user concerns over data privacy and how regulations affect adoption in rural vs. urban areas.

**Expected Insights or Outcomes:** A compliance framework to reduce fraud losses by 25-30% through AI tools (e.g., Visa Protect-like investments), with projected cost savings of 7-9% from regulatory alignment and enhanced user retention via transparent privacy policies.
