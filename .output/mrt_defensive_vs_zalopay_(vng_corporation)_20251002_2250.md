## Defensive Research Brief 1

#### Research Brief 1: Enhancing Social Payment Virality to Counter Zalo's Ecosystem Lock-In
**Research Objective**: What are the most effective strategies for integrating seamless social P2P and group payment features into MoMo's app (or via partnerships) to reverse our 20% engagement decline and prevent 2-3M user migrations to ZaloPay's chat-based tools?

**Strategic Context**: ZaloPay's "Zalo Group Pay" exploits Zalo's 96% penetration and our isolated app model, targeting Gen Z/millennials (93% daily Zalo users) where our chat feature lags (12% delivery rate, <33% retention). With P2P transactions dropping to 11M/month, this threatens our core payment volume (38-39% YoY growth at risk) and overall ecosystem stickiness. Defending here protects our 68% share by making MoMo indispensable for social finance, while enabling offensive plays like cross-app incentives to poach Zalo users.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Benchmark ZaloPay's social features (e.g., group splits, gifting in chats) against global leaders like WeChat Pay or Venmo, including adoption rates and viral coefficients in Vietnam.
- Analyze MoMo user data gaps: Demographic breakdowns of non-P2P users (56% untried chat), A/B tests on notification overload fixes, and integration feasibility with popular social apps (e.g., Zalo, Facebook Messenger) via open APIs.
- Market trends: 2025 surveys on Gen Z social payment preferences (e.g., viral challenges, zero-fee transfers); competitor migration patterns (e.g., 5% cashback incentives' ROI); regulatory sandbox opportunities for cross-app P2P under State Bank of Vietnam guidelines.
- Case studies: Successful social fintech pivots in SEA (e.g., GCash's chat integrations) and user pain points in Vietnam's cashless shift.

**Expected Insights**: Quantify engagement uplift potential (e.g., target >2 P2P txns/user/month) and cost-benefit of features like "MoMo Social Split" (budget ~300B VND). This will enable decisions on Q4 2025 product launches, marketing ROI (>300% via influencers), and partnerships to boost retention to >50%, turning defense into 10-15% YoY P2P growth and countering ZaloPay's 25-30% transaction surge.

## Defensive Research Brief 2

#### Research Brief 2: Building Gen Z Loyalty Through Entertainment and Gaming Integrations
**Research Objective**: How can MoMo deepen integrations with gaming, short-form content, and rewards ecosystems to capture 1.5-2M Gen Z users from ZaloPay's VNG-backed "Play & Pay" model, addressing our fluctuating 800k-1.3M monthly gaming transactions?

**Strategic Context**: Gen Z (18-25) dominates digital entertainment (5-7 hours/day on TikTok/games, 58 min/day TikTok), but our transactional partnerships fail to retain them (<10 min/session, 61% penetration slip). ZaloPay's VNG ecosystem (e.g., in-app purchases in Võ Lâm Truyền Kỳ) exploits this, aiming for 55% Gen Z share and 50% YoY entertainment GMV growth to 100T+ VND. As a super-app, MoMo must fuse finance with lifestyle to defend millennial/Gen Z loyalty (our acquisition down to 400k/month), preventing share erosion in the $12.5B e-commerce/gaming market and enabling offensive expansion into high-value segments.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Gen Z behaviors: 2025 surveys (e.g., Statista, Decision Lab) on fintech-entertainment fusion preferences (e.g., cashback on in-game buys, installment for tickets); cohort analysis of MoMo's low-engagement gamers vs. ZaloPay's 20% conversion from views to payments.
- Ecosystem opportunities: VNG gaming benchmarks (titles, user overlap with Zalo's 70M ZaloPay users); potential MoMo partnerships with TikTok, YouTube, or local developers (e.g., LacBird's cultural games); AI personalization for rewards (e.g., virtual items via social shares).
- Competitive gaps: ZaloPay's KOL campaigns (50+ influencers, 300B VND budget) vs. MoMo's; ROI of freemium models in SEA gaming (e.g., 60% retention via cohorts); EV/OTT expansions like Spotify integrations for group bookings.
- Barriers: Regulatory hurdles for gaming payments (SBV guidelines); talent needs for immersive features amid Vietnam's 15% annual gaming growth to $1.66B.

**Expected Insights**: Identify top 3-5 integrations (e.g., "MoMo Game Rewards" with 15% conversion target) and projected GMV uplift (>30% in entertainment). This will inform Q1 2026 launches, budget allocation (e.g., 400B VND for Gen Z campaigns), and retention strategies (>60% for new users), positioning MoMo to counter ZaloPay's 200% revenue growth in tied services and capture white-space in Gen Z's $2.42B gaming market by 2029.

## Defensive Research Brief 3

#### Research Brief 3: Strengthening Ride-Hailing and Mobility Partnerships to Neutralize Exclusivity Risks
**Research Objective**: What partnership models and incentives can MoMo deploy to deepen Grab integrations (and explore alternatives like Be/Xanh SM) and migrate 1-1.5M urban users from ZaloPay's "Zalo-Grab Seamless Pay," given our low 4k MAU in this segment?

**Strategic Context**: ZaloPay's official Grab status since 2023 enables closed-loop experiences (e.g., chat bookings with 10% cashback), exploiting our superficial ties and the 35% YoY ride-hailing growth ($1.05B market). With Grab's 55% SEA share and potential e-wallet wind-down creating flux, this threatens our urban millennial/Gen Z penetration (down 8 points QoQ to 61%), adding 120T VND to ZaloPay's GMV and eroding our lead in daily services. Defending partnerships safeguards ecosystem synergies, while countering with multi-platform deals reinforces MoMo as the default wallet for Vietnam's 20M+ Grab users and EV mobility boom.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Partnership dynamics: Current Grab-ZaloPay exclusivity terms (e.g., priority processing, data sharing); MoMo's integration benchmarks vs. competitors; opportunities post-Grab e-wallet end (July 2025?); alternative alliances (Be Group's $30M funding, Xanh SM's EV focus at 45% CAGR).
- User metrics: Urban cohort analysis (Hanoi/HCMC, 70% Zalo overlap) for MoMo-to-ZaloPay switches via Grab (>200k/quarter target); payment trends in ride-hailing (cashless dominance, 500k+ txns/month potential); incentives efficacy (e.g., 10% cashback ROI >250%).
- Market trends: 2025 ride-hailing forecasts (19.5% CAGR to $2.56B by 2030, EV shift); regulatory impacts (Decree 10/2020 on licensing, SBV digital guidelines); joint campaigns (e.g., 400B VND shared budgets for "Pay Smarter" pushes).
- Risks/Opportunities: Data privacy in shared dashboards; expansion to GrabFood/Mart for lifestyle bundles; tourist QR integrations amid 108M domestic tourists.

**Expected Insights**: Map negotiation leverage (e.g., MoMo's 33M users for volume deals) and migration tactics (e.g., transaction import perks for >70% user overlap). This will enable Q4 2025 rollouts like "MoMo-Grab One-Tap," targeting 500k monthly txns and 25% QoQ growth in active users, countering ZaloPay's 40% transaction uplift and securing 15%+ partnership revenue share to defend urban market position.

## Defensive Research Brief 4

#### Research Brief 4: Navigating Regulatory and Innovation Landscapes for Holistic Market Defense
**Research Objective**: How can MoMo leverage regulatory changes and emerging tech (e.g., AI, open banking) to preempt ZaloPay's compliance positioning and innovation edges, ensuring sustained 68% share amid projected 23.1% market CAGR to 2029?

**Strategic Context**: ZaloPay's strategies emphasize SBV alignment (e.g., open API sandboxes for social fintech), potentially framing us as less innovative while they capture 2-3% share via viral growth. Broader risks include talent shortages, tech disruptions (e.g., AI analytics), and regulatory scrutiny on partnerships/exclusivity, which could amplify all threats. As a $2B+ unicorn, MoMo must proactively innovate across core (payments), productivity (analytics), incubation (Gen Z features), and transformation (EVs/social) zones to maintain trust, financial inclusion, and leadership in a $16.52B market by 2029—turning defense into offensive dominance.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Regulatory horizon: 2025 SBV updates on P2P limits, partnership exclusivity, and digital sandboxes; impacts of cashless initiatives (e.g., NAPAS network) on MoMo vs. ZaloPay; global SEA precedents (e.g., Indonesia's fintech regs).
- Innovation benchmarks: ZaloPay's AI-driven iterations (20% quarterly cycles) vs. MoMo's; emerging tech like blockchain for secure migrations or AI for personalized onboarding; talent gaps in Vietnam's fintech (e.g., VNG's edge in data analytics).
- Holistic threats: Cross-strategy user surveys on NPS (>70 target) and satisfaction (e.g., MoMo's <33% retention vs. ZaloPay's goals); migration forecasting (500k/quarter risks); counter-plays like super-app expansions (e.g., loans at 8% interest tied to rides/gaming).
- Long-term scenarios: Blind spots in EV mobility (45% CAGR) and international QR (ZaloPay's Asia expansion); ROI of R&D investments (~500B VND) for features like AI fraud detection.

**Expected Insights**: Prioritize 2-3 regulatory advocacy moves (e.g., lobbying for open APIs) and innovation roadmaps (e.g., AI boosts to >50% retention). This will guide Q1 2026 decisions on compliance budgets, talent hires, and transformative pilots, enabling 15-20% YoY GMV growth, NPS uplift, and proactive counters to erode ZaloPay's projected 58% share ambitions while strengthening MoMo's unicorn valuation.
