### Defensive Research Brief 1: Strengthening Merchant Network and B2B Segment

**Research Objective**: Clarify effective strategies for expanding the merchant network in the SME and B2B segments in Vietnam for 2025-2026, focusing on attracting and retaining merchants from competitors like VNPay, while evaluating the impact of QR trends and AI integration on conversion rates.

**Strategic Context**: As MoMo's CEO, I am most concerned about VNPay's Strategy 1, where they leverage their 350,000 acceptance points to attack B2B, potentially leading to a loss of 20-30% of our SME merchants, indirectly reducing GMV and user market share from 68% to below 60%. With MoMo having only about 200,000 points, protecting this segment is key to maintaining our leading position, preventing user churn through daily transactions, and strengthening the super-app ecosystem, especially as the QR market grows at 14% CAGR but competition from bank apps reduces e-wallet usage frequency.

**Investigation Areas**: 
- Analyze MoMo's current merchant data compared to VNPay (quantity, geographic distribution by F&B, retail, SME in Tier-2/3).
- Trends in QR and POS integration adoption for B2B, including case studies from SEA countries like Thailand (PromptPay) and the impact of Decree 52/2024 on cashless payments.
- Evaluate merchant incentive programs (fee reductions, VNeDOC e-invoice integration) and cross-marketing effectiveness via Zalo/Facebook targeting 50,000 SMEs.
- Survey merchant switching risks (NPS, feedback from 1,000 pilot businesses) and B2B GMV growth forecasting models (based on FiinGroup and NHNN reports).

**Expected Insights**: The research will provide data to decide on investing 5-10 trillion VND in the "MoMo Merchant Boost" program (free POS/QR conversion, partnerships with 20 banks), aiming to increase merchants to 300,000 points in 12 months, forecast 25% B2B GMV growth, and reduce user market share loss risk to below 3%, thereby turning defense into a counter-attack by poaching merchants from VNPay.

### Defensive Research Brief 2: Enhancing Financial Products and Bank Partnerships

**Research Objective**: Identify deep bank partnership models to develop financial products (BNPL, quick loans, savings) for Gen Z/Millennials, evaluate 2025 AML compliance risks, and ways to reduce NPL below 1.5%, to counter VNPay's Finance Hub incursion.

**Strategic Context**: VNPay's Strategy 2 exploits our partnership weakness (only 10 banks for MoMo vs. 40+ for them), potentially attracting 2 million users from us, reducing financial market share from 50% in BNPL to 40-45%. With the BNPL market growing at 26.7% CAGR to 2030 and new regulations requiring biometric verification, lack of deep integration will undermine user trust, affecting the super-app ecosystem and service fee revenue (currently 30% of total revenue). As CEO, I prioritize protecting this segment to maintain user loyalty and counter delinquency risks.

**Investigation Areas**: 
- Analyze MoMo financial product performance (CLO, Túi Thần Tài) vs. VNPay, including NPL data, usage rates (from Decision Lab Q4/2024), and AI eKYC/biometric trends.
- Successful partnership case studies in Vietnam/SEA (e.g., Grab-Fin for BNPL) and impact of Decree 94/2025 on Fintech testing.
- Survey Gen Z user needs (1 million samples via TikTok/Shopee) for quick loans, bank-linked savings, and wallet transfer incentives (500,000 VND cashback).
- Evaluate AML regulatory risks and audits with NHNN, including financial fee revenue forecasting models (based on Juniper Research on embedded finance).

**Expected Insights**: Results will support expanding partnerships to 25 banks, launching "MoMo Finance Secure" with 5-minute eKYC and competitive rates, expected to attract 1.5 million new users, increase financial GMV by 30%, and reduce NPL to 1.2%, allowing MoMo to shift from defense to leading the BNPL market with a "Digital Financial Security" campaign to regain compliance advantage.

### 3. Defensive Brief

### Defensive Research Brief 3: Expanding Cross-Border and Rural Payments

**Research Objective**: Evaluate opportunities for expanding QR cross-border and remittances in rural/Tier-2/3 areas, focusing on international partnerships (Visa, UnionPay) to capture 10-15% of the user dip in October 2025, countering VNPay's Global Transfer plan.

**Strategic Context**: VNPay's Strategy 3 targets MoMo's geographic weakness (low rural penetration, basic cross-border partnerships), potentially increasing their users to 22% by exploiting 16-18 billion USD in remittances and ASEAN QR linkages. With MoMo's active users dipping sharply in October 2025, losing share in this segment will weaken QR GMV growth (14.27% CAGR to 2032), affecting our #1 position and SEA expansion. I am concerned this will isolate MoMo in 2025 interoperability, requiring action to protect 33 million users.

**Investigation Areas**: 
- Analyze MoMo user geographic data (Tier-3 cities, cross-border transactions) vs. VNPay, including blockchain/stablecoin trends and Vietnam-Laos/Thailand QR linkages (from SBV Decision 234/QD-NHNN).
- Remittances and SoftPOS NFC case studies in SEA (e.g., mBridge project), impact of 2025 Digital Technology Law on blockchain pilots.
- Survey 500,000 rural users (via telecom partners) on international QR needs, 5% cashback, and 50% lower transfer fees.
- Forecast rural/cross-border QR GMV growth (based on Vietnam Blockchain Association and NHNN reports on 87 SWIFT banks).

**Expected Insights**: The research will provide basis for investing 3-5 trillion VND in "MoMo Global QR", partnering with Visa/UnionPay for 1 million transactions/month and 100,000 rural QR points, expected to increase rural users by 20%, capture 1 million users from the dip, and boost international fee revenue by 35%, helping MoMo lead cross-border instead of being overtaken by VNPay.

### Defensive Research Brief 4: Maintaining User Retention and Regulatory Compliance

**Research Objective**: Identify comprehensive user retention strategies (AI personalization, loyalty programs) combined with 2025 regulatory compliance (AML, interoperability), to reduce overall churn below 5% and counter VNPay's conversion campaigns across their 3 strategies.

**Strategic Context**: As the biggest concern, the combination of VNPay's 3 strategies could cause continuous user dips (like October 2025), reducing active users from 33 million to below 30 million, impacting trust and 2B+ USD valuation. With e-wallet maturation trends (from explosive growth to loyalty focus, per FiinGroup), MoMo needs to protect the ecosystem via data-driven retention and PSD3-like compliance (EU trends influencing Vietnam), avoiding regulatory risks that slow innovation.

**Investigation Areas**: 
- Analyze MoMo user churn data (September-October 2025, Gen Z/rural segments) and benchmark with VNPay/ZaloPay (from Decision Lab and Reputa Insight).
- AI trends for personalization (fraud detection, behavioral biometrics) and impact of Decree 94/2025, PSD3 on open banking in Vietnam.
- Survey 2 million users on loyalty factors (NPS >70, "Safe Wallet Transfer" counter programs) and successful retention case studies (WeChat Pay in China).
- Evaluate aggregate risks (cyber threats, ESG compliance) and 2026 user market share forecasting models (based on Juniper Research on sustainable Fintech).

**Expected Insights**: Results will support implementing "MoMo Loyalty AI Hub" with biometric security and personalized incentives, expected to retain 85% of new users, increase NPS to 75, and total revenue by 25%, allowing MoMo not only to defend but counter-attack with a national "Trusted E-Wallet" campaign, solidifying leading position ahead of 2025 regulations.
