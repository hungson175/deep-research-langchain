## Defensive Research Brief 1

### Defensive Research Brief 1: Safeguarding Youth Market Penetration and Engagement

**Research Objective**: What are the current and projected engagement levels of Gen Z and millennials (ages 18-34) with MoMo versus ZaloPay in Vietnam as of Q3 2025, and what tailored features or incentives could reverse any declining trends in this demographic to prevent user migration?

**Strategic Context**: Gen Z and millennials represent 45% of Vietnam's under-30 population and drive 55% of digital economy growth, with high virality in social and entertainment spending. ZaloPay's attacks exploit our onboarding frictions (e.g., ID requirements) and lack of integrated lifestyle features, potentially eroding our 68% overall market share by capturing 3-4 million youth users. Defending this segment is critical to sustaining long-term user acquisition, as youth loyalty fuels ecosystem expansion and protects our $2B+ valuation against ZaloPay's projected 10% youth share gain by 2026. Failure here risks isolating MoMo as a "legacy" wallet amid a $7.19B market growing at 23.1% CAGR.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Demographic breakdowns: Analyze MoMo's internal user data (ages 18-34) for engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, transaction frequency) in 2025, benchmarked against ZaloPay's 16M user base and public surveys (e.g., Statista, Nielsen) on youth wallet preferences.
- Pain points and preferences: Deep dive into Gen Z behaviors via focus groups or app reviews (Reddit, TikTok), focusing on barriers like registration hurdles, desire for gamified savings (8-13% interest challenges), and integration with daily habits (e.g., TikTok shopping, wellness apps).
- Competitor tactics: Track ZaloPay's Q4 2025 "Gen Z Hub" rollout and influencer campaigns (200+ nano-influencers) for effectiveness in user acquisition, including ROI from cashback incentives and university partnerships.
- Market trends: Examine Vietnam's youth digital spending patterns (e.g., 85% mobile e-commerce, $24B market), regulatory impacts on easy onboarding (e.g., 2023 Data Protection Law), and successful counterexamples from regional peers (e.g., GrabPay's youth features in Indonesia).

**Expected Insights**: This research will enable decisions on product roadmaps, such as piloting frictionless onboarding (e.g., biometric verification) and youth-specific features like AI-personalized rewards or TikTok integrations, targeting 30%+ youth acquisition growth. It will quantify migration risks (e.g., 15-20% churn potential) to prioritize budget allocation (20% of marketing to influencers) and measure success via KPIs like 75% 3-month retention, turning defensive youth focus into offensive market share gains.

### Defensive Research Brief 2: Bolstering Social Payment Integrations and Virality

**Research Objective**: How can MoMo enhance its social payment features (P2P transfers, group funds) to match or exceed ZaloPay's Zalo-integrated ecosystem, including assessments of potential partnerships for viral adoption by Q1 2026?

**Strategic Context**: Our declining social engagement (20% drop in P2P users/transactions from Jan-Sep 2025) exposes a vulnerability to ZaloPay's "social default" strategy, leveraging Zalo's 78M MAU for seamless chat-based payments. This could siphon 2-3M users, boosting ZaloPay's share to 58-60% and undermining our super-app ecosystem. As Vietnam's social media penetration hits 78% (Zalo at 82%), protecting social features is essential for user retention, viral growth, and tying payments to lifestyle services—core to defending our leadership in a cashless economy projected to reach $16.52B by 2029.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Feature benchmarking: Compare MoMo's P2P/group tools (e.g., volatility in group fund creations) against ZaloPay's "Zalo Group Pay" (in-chat splits, gifting), using user testing and analytics from Zalo's 2B daily messages to identify UX gaps like app-switching friction.
- Integration opportunities: Explore API partnerships with social platforms (e.g., Zalo OA, Facebook Messenger, TikTok) for embedded payments, including feasibility under NAPAS regulations and costs for multi-app QR support.
- User sentiment and migration drivers: Analyze public data (Reddit complaints, app store reviews) and surveys on social payment preferences, focusing on viral mechanics (e.g., referral codes) and trust factors (fraud detection via UnionPay).
- Competitive execution: Monitor ZaloPay's Q4 2025 pilots (1M A/B tests) and campaigns (5-10% cashback via 10K OAs) for adoption rates, plus broader trends in social commerce (70% cashless transactions).

**Expected Insights**: Insights will inform strategic pivots, such as launching "MoMo Social Link" with chat integrations and 40% QoQ MAU growth targets, enabling decisions on R&D investments ($50M+ for API development) and partnerships (e.g., 50 university communities). This will provide metrics for counter-campaigns (e.g., NPS >70) to reduce churn below 10%, converting social weaknesses into ecosystem strengths and blocking ZaloPay's 25% transaction volume uplift.

### Defensive Research Brief 3: Expanding Entertainment and Gaming Partnerships for Ecosystem Lock-In

**Research Objective**: What strategic partnerships in Vietnam's entertainment and gaming sectors can MoMo pursue to integrate payments seamlessly, countering VNG's dominance and capturing 15-20% more transaction volume in this segment by mid-2026?

**Strategic Context**: Our stagnant entertainment transactions (2-3M monthly, 1.1-1.7M users) lag in a $10B+ digital entertainment market, where ZaloPay exploits VNG's gaming ecosystem (80% revenue, 79M QAU) for "pay-and-play" features, potentially shifting 1.5-2M users and eroding our share in Gen Z-heavy impulse buys. With Vietnam's gaming boom and 5G enabling IoT/entertainment synergies, fortifying partnerships is vital to transform MoMo into a true super-app, driving 40% YoY growth in tied services (e.g., loans) and safeguarding our 33M-user base against ZaloPay's 60% revenue uplift projection.

**Investigation Areas**:
- Market mapping: Assess Vietnam's entertainment/gaming landscape (e.g., $43B digital economy slice), including key players (VNG titles like Free Fire, cinema chains, OTT platforms) and untapped opportunities (e.g., TikTok events, music festivals).
- Partnership benchmarks: Evaluate successful integrations (e.g., ZaloPay's VNG embeds, Grab's cross-promos) versus MoMo's current ties, analyzing transaction uplift (25% partner fees) and user crossover (20% gamer adoption).
- Regulatory and tech feasibility: Review compliance for in-game payments (e.g., Cybersecurity Law 2026, UnionPay for cross-border) and tech stacks (AI personalization, QR linking) to enable one-tap experiences.
- Competitor moves: Track ZaloPay's Q4 2025 rollouts (5M VNG users) and Q1 2026 exclusives (20+ partners, 10-20% discounts), plus global trends (e.g., Xsolla's payment solutions in SEA gaming).

**Expected Insights**: This will guide partnership deals (e.g., 15+ entertainment tie-ups with 30% QoQ volume targets) and feature launches (e.g., gamified top-ups), enabling ROI calculations (5:1 on marketing) and decisions on exclusive incentives to double our segment transactions (from 2.8M baseline). Insights will quantify poaching risks, supporting offensive strategies like co-branded challenges to achieve 55% gaming payment share and reinforce MoMo's ecosystem moat.
