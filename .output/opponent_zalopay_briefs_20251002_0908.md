## Competitive Research Brief 1

### Research Brief 1: Enhancing Gen Z Engagement Through Social Payment Features

**Clear Research Objective:** How can ZaloPay (VNG Corporation) leverage Zalo's social graph to capture Gen Z and millennial users from MoMo by introducing superior social payment features like group gifting and viral P2P transfers?

**Background Context:** MoMo's internal data reveals fluctuating and declining P2P transfer volumes in 2025 (e.g., drops from 13.7M transactions in January to 10.3M in July), with inconsistent group fund engagement (active users peaking at 2.5M in August but falling to 1.6M in September). Public sentiment shows 90% of Gen Z users (18-24) employ multiple super apps for promotions, indicating low stickiness and underserved social integration needs. ZaloPay can exploit this gap, as Zalo's 75M+ users (dominant for messaging and groups) provide a seamless entry point for viral, social-driven payments that MoMo's standalone app lacks, targeting Gen Z's preference for peer-influenced, FOMO-driven transactions (67% social influence per reviews).

**Specific Investigation Areas:** 
- Use query_momo_data to query: "Engagement metrics of MoMo's P2P and group features among users aged 18-35 in Q1-Q3 2025" and "Decline reasons in P2P transaction volumes by month in 2025."
- Use tavily_search for: "Gen Z payment preferences Vietnam 2025 social features reviews MoMo vs ZaloPay" and "Viral social payment trends TikTok Zalo integrations 2025."
- Analyze ZaloPay internal data on current Zalo-integrated P2P usage; survey 1,000 Gen Z Zalo users on desired features (e.g., in-app gifting tied to chats).

**Expected Strategic Insights:** This research will identify precise Gen Z pain points in MoMo (e.g., lack of seamless group sharing) and quantify ZaloPay's potential uplift (e.g., 20-30% engagement boost via social virality). It will enable decisions on feature prioritization, such as launching Zalo-chat-embedded payments, and A/B testing viral campaigns to convert 10-15% of MoMo's multi-app Gen Z users.

**Success Metrics:** Increase ZaloPay's Gen Z active users by 25% within 6 months; achieve 15% higher P2P transaction frequency vs. MoMo benchmarks (measured via internal analytics); track net promoter score (NPS) improvement to 70+ among 18-24 segment through post-launch surveys.

### Research Brief 2: Expanding into Entertainment and Gaming Ecosystems

**Clear Research Objective:** How can ZaloPay (VNG Corporation) integrate payments deeply into VNG's gaming and entertainment ecosystem to surpass MoMo's volatile gaming transaction volumes and capture Gen Z entertainment spend?

**Background Context:** MoMo's 2025 gaming transaction data shows high volatility (e.g., 224B VND and 1.3M transactions in January dropping to 121B VND and 716K in September), with modest entertainment partnerships like Netflix/Spotify (~50-60B VND/month steady but not growing aggressively). Public trends indicate Gen Z (85% daily social media users) spends heavily on TikTok/YouTube Shorts for entertainment, yet MoMo lacks ecosystem synergies. ZaloPay's VNG backing (games, music, content) and Zalo integration position it to exploit this, transforming payments into an embedded "entertainment wallet" for seamless in-game purchases and streaming, addressing MoMo's seasonal dips and limited Gen Z retention.

**Specific Investigation Areas:** 
- Use query_momo_data to query: "Breakdown of MoMo gaming transaction volumes and user demographics (focus on 18-35) by month in 2025" and "Transaction growth rates for MoMo entertainment partnerships (e.g., streaming apps) in Q1-Q3 2025."
- Use tavily_search for: "Vietnam Gen Z gaming and entertainment spending trends 2025 MoMo integrations" and "VNG Corporation gaming revenue and payment opportunities 2025."
- Review VNG internal metrics on Zalo users' gaming engagement; conduct focus groups with 500 Gen Z gamers on payment friction points in MoMo vs. ZaloPay.

**Expected Strategic Insights:** Research will reveal MoMo's gaming weaknesses (e.g., 40% volume drops in off-peak months) and opportunities for ZaloPay to bundle payments with VNG titles (e.g., 30% of Zalo's 100M users are gamers). This will inform decisions like co-branded in-game wallets or loyalty rewards, enabling a 20% market share gain in entertainment payments and positioning ZaloPay as the default for VNG's ecosystem.

**Success Metrics:** Boost ZaloPay gaming/entertainment transaction volume by 40% YoY within 12 months; secure 20% of VNG's total gaming revenue via integrated payments; measure user retention at 60%+ for Gen Z gamers (via cohort analysis) compared to MoMo's fluctuating benchmarks.

### Research Brief 3: Deepening Partnerships and Financial Services Offerings

**Clear Research Objective:** How can ZaloPay (VNG Corporation) expand exclusive partnerships (e.g., with Grab) and enhance financial services depth to erode MoMo's market lead in underserved segments like quick loans and savings?

**Background Context:** Internal MoMo data indicates zero Grab transactions in 2025 despite a 2023 partnership, signaling execution failures or low adoption, while financial services metrics were largely inaccessible (suggesting potential internal gaps or stagnation). Public reports highlight Vietnam's low credit penetration (3%) and fintech growth to $70B by 2032, with Gen Z driving BNPL/sustainable finance but using multiple apps (57% own 3+ e-wallets). ZaloPay's official Grab partnership since 2023 (covering 57% bank market) and 100+ services (loans at 8-13% interest, investments) allow it to exploit MoMo's partnership underperformance and shallower ecosystem, targeting millennials in urban/rural gaps.

**Specific Investigation Areas:** 
- Use query_momo_data to query: "Transaction volumes from MoMo's Grab and financial services partnerships (loans, savings) in 2025" and "User adoption rates for MoMo BNPL and investment products among 25-40 year-olds in Q1-Q3 2025."
- Use tavily_search for: "MoMo vs ZaloPay partnership performance Vietnam 2025 Grab financial services reviews" and "Vietnam millennial demand for integrated loans savings 2025 trends."
- Audit ZaloPay's Grab integration data; benchmark against MoMo via app store reviews and survey 800 millennial users on financial service preferences.

**Expected Strategic Insights:** This will uncover MoMo's partnership voids (e.g., untapped Grab volume) and financial depth limitations (e.g., lower loan uptake), guiding ZaloPay to deepen Grab exclusives (e.g., bundled loans for rides) and launch AI-personalized savings. Insights will enable resource allocation for 15% user migration from MoMo's financial segments, accelerating ZaloPay's 149-196% revenue growth.

**Success Metrics:** Achieve 30% increase in Grab-linked transactions within 9 months; grow ZaloPay financial services users (loans/savings) by 25% YoY, surpassing MoMo benchmarks; monitor market share to 55% in partnered payments via third-party reports like Cimigo surveys.
